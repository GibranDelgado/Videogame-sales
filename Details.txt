Thank you for your interest in my project.

Execute the "Main.py" script if you want to get the elements to recreate the dashboard. This going to generate a new folder called "Query_results" with the excel files produced by the sql queries. "Used_files" folder contains the vgsales dataset and a text file with the used queries. If you want to add a new query, just write it at the bottom of the "queries.txt" file, respecting the order.
